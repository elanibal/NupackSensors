# Designing Novel Toehold Sensors 

Toehold riboswitches are a de-novo designed regulators of gene expression afecting translation. They have been used in many aplications including biocomputing and biosensors for RNA viruses including Ã©bola, ZIka, Norovirus, PVY, and many more.

This repository is a open tool for designing novel toehold sensors for a given RNA. It interacts with NUPACK software for annalysis of RNA structures and all the code is writen in Python 3.0. 

# Dependencies
1.-NUPACK 3.0 (http://nupack.org/).

2.-Python 3


# References

Most of the code shown here is built on the top of an app from the iGem group EPFL (2017) http://2017.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Results/Toehold.

The scoring metrics for the designs were taken from  Ma, D. et al.  (Low-cost detection of norovirus using paper-based cell-free systems and synbody-based viral enrichment. Synth.  Biol.3, ysy018 (2018))
