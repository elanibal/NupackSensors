# NupackSensors

This repository is composed of three main jupyter Notebooks with the following objectives.
To be able to run mosft of this Notebooks you will need NUPACK.

 
A) Calculate the Free energy of the sensor-trigger complex along the Strand Displacement reactions using NUPACK
B) Calculate Obtention of Key thermodinamic parameters of the sensors using NUPACK and Multiple Linear Model selection
C) Build novel sensors for a novel RNA
