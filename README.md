# NupackSensors

This jupyter notebook is an open tool for designing novel Toehold Sensors for a given RNA sequence. 


It interact with NUPACK (Nuclei Acid Pack) software for RNA structure analysis and design, and ranks the best designs of sensors for a given RNA. 

Most of the code here is recycled from from the iGem group ELFL (2017) http://2017.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Results/Toehold and the scoring metric for the designs was taken from  Ma, D. et al. (Low-cost detection of norovirus using paper-based cell-free systems and synbody-based viral enrichment. Synth.  Biol.3, ysy018 (2018))


Works only on linux so far
To be able to run this Notebooks you will need to install NUPACK first.
