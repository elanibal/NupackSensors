# Designing Novel Toehold Sensors 

Toehold riboswitches are a de-novo designed regulators of gene expression afecting translation. They have been used in many aplications including biocomputing and biosensors for RNA viruses including Ã©bola, ZIka, Norovirus, PVY, and many more.

This repository is a open tool for designing novel toehold sensors for a given RNA. It interacts with NUPACK software for annalysis of RNA structures and all the code is writen in Python 3.0. 

# Dependencies
1.-NUPACK 3.0 (http://nupack.org/).

2.-Python 3

# Fast prototyping Toehold Sensors in cell-free reactions

Once toehold sensors are design, they can be fastlly screened in Cell-free reactions using PCR products, and In vitro transcribed trigger RNAs. We Use LacZ output, which gives a colorimetrics change from yellow ( negative controls ) to purple.
